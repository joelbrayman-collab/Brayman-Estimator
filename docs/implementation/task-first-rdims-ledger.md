# Task-First UX, Guided Tasks and standalone RDIMS — progress ledger (from 31 Oct 2026)

Mandate: Joel, 31 Oct 2026 ("CALIBRAYTAI — TASK-FIRST UX + GUIDED TASKS + RDIMS TRANSFORMATION"). One development
cycle through deployment; no routine approval stops (Joel: "all tasks and access are approved").

## Baseline (protected)
- Live: `7087d0d0`, Render `dep-dbj4bnff3r2c73eu4qvg`, database revision `s6f7a8b9c0d1`.
- Verification: 3,732 tests, no skips; 302/302 browser checks; migration rehearsal and production migration passed;
  post-release integrity explained; signed-out Live smoke passed.
- Branch: `feature/task-first-rdims-2026-10-31` (worktree), from main `7087d0d0`.

## Steps
1. Baseline recorded; branch created. AiRIA reference = read-only copy of `Discovery-Search` origin/main `b1ec1d1e`.
2. Tooling follow-up from e2p1 (done): `release_migrate.sh` records the rows the migration seeded
   (`MIGRATION_SEEDED=t=n,...` in the release state); `postrelease_check.sh` reads the seeded tables' counts on the
   live database (read-only) and `migration_check.py postcheck-rows` proves live = backup + new tables + exactly the
   declared seed, table by table; anything else still stops. Tests: `tests/test_release_postcheck_seed.py`.
